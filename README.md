# How do I run it?

1. Download the repository by whatever means you'd like
2. Open the ```~/Lost-Souls/Lost-Souls``` directory
3. Now, simply run the project locally (I suggest using the ```Live Server``` extension on ```Visual Studio Code``` but however you want to run it works fine!)

## The *boring* stuff

This project was made for my 5th semester Computer Science Game Programming course's final project which got a ```94.4%``` :)

The whole thing was done over the course of 2 weeks, but the actual coding and building was more accurately a week. I had a great time working on this and think it turned out pretty good! 

### Issues

The game isn't perfect. My friend ([NoahGJAC](https://github.com/NoahGJAC)) and I spent a long time trying to work through these bugs but we ultimately had to sacrifice them so that we could focus on getting everything we wanted out.

- Movement ```[STILL IN-GAME]```
    - Your character's movement feels slippery, almost like you're ice skating. This could be fixed by setting the movement to **0** when you **change directions** or **stop moving**
- Collision detection ```[STILL IN-GAME]```
    - Our teacher mentioned to the class that collision detection is a challenging issue that game devs often struggle with and I can tell why. I honestly spent hours trying to figure out what part of the **player hitbox** I wasn't checking to no avail :( so if you really try to break it, you can **walk through some walls** and even sometimes **get stuck**.
- Map rendering ```[RESOLVED]```
    - Prior to the project, I had never even thought about how to **render** or even **create a map**. To build the map I used tiles from [Szadi art](https://szadiart.itch.io/) which look great! The only issue is I didn't realize that rotating a tile in **Tiled**'s map editor would cause so many problems. Because the tile was not recognized as a sprite in the tilesheet, it essentially corrupted all rotated tiles. The issue here is that I rotated a lot of tiles to build the maps. To fix this, I had to go through each map and modify the **.json**'s to then create a map that made sense. So the end result are essentially maps designed in **.json**.
- Hit detection ```[STILL IN-GAME]```
    - When you hit an enemy that is mid attack, they enter their hurt state but once that ends, they go back to their attacking state. This is a problem because if you dodge an attack and slide behind an enemy to attack them, if their attack is still in progress, they'll immediately turn to face you and their attack will go through instantly which can result in your death.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> Okay! You made it this far, if you're really that interested, below are all the pre-building blueprinting & planning documentations that we had to write up for our project proposal. While not everything we planned on doing caame out in the end reesult, having it all written and drawn out before starting was a huge help for development!
