# Game Programming Project - Pok√©mon the Trading Card Game

> [!note]
> This was taken from a project I did in university so the scope is **much** larger than what I'm expecting from you in terms of number of features!

## ‚úíÔ∏è Description

In this turn-based battle card game, players assume the role of a Pok√©mon trainer and use their Pok√©mon to battle their opponent's Pok√©mon. Players play Pok√©mon to the field and attack their opponent's Pok√©mon. A Pok√©mon that has sustained enough damage is Knocked Out, and the player who knocked it out draws a Prize card. There are usually six Prize cards, and the primary win condition is to draw all of them. Other ways to win are by knocking out all the Pok√©mon the opponent has on the field so that the opponent has none left, or if at the beginning of their opponent's turn there are no cards left to draw in the opponent's deck.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay

Players begin by having one player select heads or tails, and the other flips a coin; the winner of the coin flip will decide who goes first or second. The player going first cannot attack their first turn, unless the card says otherwise. (Dice may be used in place of coins, with even numbers representing heads and odd numbers representing tails). Players then shuffle their decks and draw seven cards, then play one Basic Pok√©mon onto the field. This Pok√©mon is known as the Active Pok√©mon and is usually the one that attacks and receives damage. If a player does not have any Basic Pok√©mon, they must shuffle and draw a new hand, and the opponent may draw one additional card. Once both players have at least one Basic Pok√©mon, they can play up to five more Basic Pok√©mon onto their "Bench" (representing the maximum-carry limit of six from the video games). Players then take the top six cards of their deck and place them to the side as Prize Cards. Play then begins with the player who won the coin flip.

Play alternates between players who may take several actions during their turn, including playing new Basic Pok√©mon, evolving their Pok√©mon, playing Trainer cards and Energy cards, and using Pok√©mon Abilities. A player may also retreat their Active Pok√©mon, switching the Active Pok√©mon with one on the Bench. At the end of their turn, a player may use one of their Active Pok√©mon's attacks, provided the prerequisite amount and types of Energy are attached to that Pok√©mon. Effects from that attack are then activated and damage may be placed on the Defending Pok√©mon; some attacks simply have effects but do not do damage. Damage may be modified depending on whether the defender has a weakness or a resistance to the attacker's Pok√©mon type. If the final damage exceeds the defending Pok√©mon's HP, it is Knocked Out, and the active player takes a prize card and ends their turn.

This implementation of _Pok√©mon the Trading Card Game_ is a single player experience with an AI. The game is played primarily with the mouse to interact with the cards and general GUI. The players can optionally hit `M` on their keyboard to mute all game sounds.

### üßµ Wireframes

> [!note]
> Your wireframes don't have to be super polished. They can even be black and white. I'm just looking for a rough idea about what you're visualizing.

![Main Menu](./images/Main-Menu.png)

- _Let's Play_ will navigate to the main game.
- _Upload Cards_ will navigation to the forms for uploading and parsing the data files for the game.
- _Change Log_ will navigate the user to a page with a list of features/changes that have been implemented throughout the development of the game.

![Game Board](./images/Game-Board.png)

We want to keep the GUI as simple and clear as possible by having cards with relevant images to act as a way for the user to intuitively navigate the game. We want to implement a layout that would look like as if one were playing a match of the Pok√©mon Trading Card Game with physical cards in real life. Clicking on any of the cards will reveal that card's details to the player.

### üé® Assets

We used [app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net/) to create the wireframes. Wireframes are the equivalent to the skeleton of a web app since they are used to describe the functionality of the product and the users experience.

We plan on following trends already found in other trading card video games, such as Pok√©mon Trading Card Game Online, Hearthstone, Magic the Gathering Arena, and Gwent.

The GUI will be kept simple and playful, as to make sure the game is easy to understand what each component does and is, as well as light hearted to keep to the Pok√©mon theme.

#### üñºÔ∏è Images

- Most images will be used from the well known community driven wikipedia site, [Bulbapedia](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Main_Page).
- Especially their [Trading Card Game section](https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Full_Art_card_(TCG)).

#### ‚úèÔ∏è Fonts

For fonts, a simple sans-serif like Roboto will look quite nice. It's a font that is legible, light on storage size, and fun to keep with the theme we're going for. We also used a more cartoonish Pokemon font for the title screen.

- [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto)

#### üîä Sounds

All sounds were taken from [freesound.org](https://freesound.org) for the actions pertaining to cards.

- [Shuffle cards](https://freesound.org/people/VKProduktion/sounds/217502/)
- [Flip card](https://freesound.org/people/Splashdust/sounds/84322/)
